# 🎯 Conditional Rendering in React

## ✅ Definition
Conditional rendering means **showing or hiding UI elements based on certain conditions** (like `if`, `&&`, or ternary operators).

React lets you decide **what to render** depending on state, props, or any logic.

## 📝 Why It’s Important
- Makes UI **dynamic** and **interactive**.  
- Helps avoid unnecessary rendering.  
- Used in real projects for features like:
  - Show login form if user is not logged in.
  - Show dashboard if user is logged in.
  - Display loading spinner while data is fetching.

## ⚡ Common Ways to Do It

### 1. **Using `&&` (AND operator)**
Best for showing something only if a condition is `true`.

```jsx
function Welcome({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      {isLoggedIn && <p>You are logged in 🎉</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
