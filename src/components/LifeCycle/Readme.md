# Question: What is Life cycle in react.

# Answer: Lifecycle is a term that refers to the different stage a component goes through from its creation to removal from the DOM(Document Object Model).

# Each stage has specific lifecycle methods for both: Class component and Functional component that you can use to perform actions of manage the component's behavior at that particular moment

# There are two versions you should know: 
# 1. Class Components lifecycle methods (traditional, still asked). 
# 2. Functional Components lifecycle with Hooks (modern).
