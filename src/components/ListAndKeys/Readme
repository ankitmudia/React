## ðŸ”¹ Lists in React
In React, we often need to **render multiple elements** from an array of data.  
We use JavaScriptâ€™s array methods (like `.map()`) to transform data into React elements.

### Example:
```jsx
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
